st.markdown("<p>AECOM's current data infrastructure exhibits a dynamic mix of onsite storage and cloud-based solutions, reflecting the "
            "diverse requirements imposed by clients across various projects. The choice of data storage solutions is often influenced by "

st.markdown("<p>In a broader context, AECOM has transitioned towards a more cloud-centric, distributed system. The majority of the company's workforce leverages OneDrive, a cloud-based storage system that synchronises local drives with the cloud. This shift towards cloud-based services, including Software as a Service (SaaS) models, has become a prevalent trend, enhancing accessibility, collaboration, and scalability for AECOM's global operations.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.markdown("<p>This decentralised approach aligns with the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) embedded in AECOM's data security framework. PoLP dictates that users, applications, and systems should only possess the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks. By implementing PoLP, the company aims to mitigate potential damage from compromised accounts or systems, reduce the attack surface, and minimise the risk of insider threats.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.markdown("<p>AECOM's commitment to robust cybersecurity is articulated in its Information Security Policy (ISP), a comprehensive document that serves as an umbrella to all other security policies and standards.

st.markdown("<p>In aligning with best practices, AECOM has adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework Special Publication (SP) 800-37. This framework encompasses five key functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Reading through AECOM's policies, it becomes evident that measures such as SPF and DKIM for emails, firewalls for data transmission, antivirus software, regular patching, and single sign-on are integral components managed by a dedicated security team.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.markdown("<p>The NIST framework serves as a structured approach to identifying, evaluating, and prioritising risks to organisational information assets. It ensures proactive management of vulnerabilities to reduce the likelihood and impact of security incidents.

st.markdown("<p>AECOM, in its commitment to data security, places a significant emphasis on General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance. GDPR mandates a stringent framework for the protection of personal data, ensuring that individuals have control over their information.

This proactive approach ensures that personal data is handled with the utmost care and in accordance with GDPR regulations.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.markdown("<p>Complementing its commitment to robust cybersecurity, AECOM utilises a Risk Assessment Matrix to systematically identify, assess, and manage risks. This matrix provides a structured framework to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of various risks, guiding the implementation of targeted security measures. The Risk Assessment Matrix is integral to AECOM's proactive risk management strategy, ensuring that potential vulnerabilities are identified and addressed preemptively.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.markdown("<p>AECOM has established a comprehensive Incident Response Plan to effectively address and mitigate the impact of security incidents. This plan outlines the step-by-step procedures to be followed in the event of a cybersecurity breach or data security incident.
